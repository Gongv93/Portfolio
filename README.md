# Summary
This is a small side project to introduce myself to web development and to create something for people to see the work I've done as a software developer. When starting this project all I knew was very basic HTML. But as I worked on it I was able to learn enough to make a presentable website. I hope for the people who look at this as a learning example can learn as much as I did.

# What I learned
Here are some of the major things I learned while creating this portfolio.

* Efficiently integrating HTML, CSS, and JS together to create a functioning website.
* OAuth2
* AJAX
* Web APIs
* Boot strap
* JQuery

# Future plans
Even though a site is at a presentable state, I believe there can be many improvements. Below are some of the following improvements that I think would help me learn even more and improve the overall experience

* Creating a more seamless heading
* Create some back-end functionality to learn how to communicate between the front and back
* Improve animations to be smoother 
* And many more that will come!
